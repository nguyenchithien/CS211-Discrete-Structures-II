# Extra Credit - Chapter 5 topics

## About

Using a tool of your choice, create a small game about the chapter 5 topics. For example:

* Give the user C(n, r) with a random value for n and r, and ask them to enter the correct answer.
* Ask the user to identify which formula belongs with which structure (Ordered, no repeats = permutation, etc.)

Some tools you could use to build the game are...:

* Scratch - https://scratch.mit.edu/
* Greenfoot - https://www.greenfoot.org/door

You can use any tool that you'd like. You can also make the game text-based and just implement it with C++, Java, or C#.
