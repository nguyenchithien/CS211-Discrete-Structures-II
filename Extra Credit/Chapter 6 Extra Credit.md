# Extra Credit - Chapter 6 topics

## About

This assignment is open-ended.

**Mini-essay option:**

Look into using probability in a real-world application. 
If you can, try to analyze the outcomes and the probability of each outcome 
(for example, buy a bag of M&Ms and determine the probability of getting each color).
If that's not possible for your topic, figure out how probability is commonly predicted
for the field, or how you would go about determining the probability for events.

Write up at least a paragraph about what you've found, and if you've done
the experiment to determine probability, write out a table of outcomes / probabilities.

**Program option:**

You can also opt to program something that deals with probability in a "real world" scenario (this does also include cards and dice, since they are games of chance)

### Topic ideas

You can come up with your own idea as well, as long as it relates to probability.

* Gambling, lottery, lootboxes
  * What's the probability of winning the lottery? How is this probability determined? How would you determine it?
  * What's the probability of winning a game at a casino?
  * What's the probability of getting certain items from lootboxes in video games? What's the estimated time it would take to get a certain item from a lootbox?
    ( Example: PUBG lootboxes - https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/9/16870834/pubg-loot-box-crate-probability-drop-rates-battlegrounds )
* Insurance, car accidents
  * How does the probability of car accidents set insurance rates?
  * How is probability of accidents / insurance prices determined for certain age ranges?
* Disease
  * What is the probability of certain behaviors (e.g., tobacco use) leading to certain diseases? For cigarettes, how was this probability determined?
* Stock market / bitcoin
  * How is probability used in the stock market?
* Genetics (e.g., mendel squares?)
  * How is probability used in genetics?
  * Given two parents with certain traits, how do you figure out the probability of their children gaining one trait or the other (i.e., recessive / dominant genes, alleles?)
* Sending out spam
  * What's the probability of people responding to spam?
  * What's the profit for each spam email responded to?
  * What's the expected profit for sending out spam?
* Predictive text / algorithms to predict
  * How does a phone predict what text you're going to write next, or what you meant?
* Procedural content in video games
  * How are random values used to build content in video games (e.g., maps, music, art)
* M&M's and assorted candies - likelyhood of getting certain colors/flavors
  * If you buy a bag of M&Ms, what's the probability of getting each color? Do the probabilities change if you buy a second bag of M&Ms?
* Games of chance (cards, dice, choosing marbles)

### Program ideas

You can come up with your own idea as well, as long as it relates to probability.

* Program a slot machine, where each picture (cherries? "bar"?) has some probability of occuring, per reel. A slot machine usually has 3 reels. What's the probability of getting 3 cherries, or 3 of any other type?
* Genetics, some up with some plant species and certain alleles, and the probability of inheriting some traits. (See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel#Contributions)
