# Extra Credit - Structures

In Chapter 5.1, we had a question about students choosing folders for
their three classes. There were four total folder colors:
**white, green, red, and blue**, and three different classes;
**English, Discrete Structures, and Biology**.

Four students chose their folders as such:

* Uryiah selected folders in an **unordered** manner: Grabbed 3 folders without
    consideration for color.
* Orlando selected folders in an **ordered** manner: Grabbing a folder first
    for English, second for Discrete Structures, and third for Biology.
* Connie selected folders in a **combination**: She chose folders of 3 different colors,
    but in no particular order.
* Pete selected a **permutation**: He chose 3 different colors, like Connie,
    and he also selected them in order like Orlando.

In this extra credit exercise, we will generate a randomized list of folders
that obey the rules above. We will use Python and step through the code a bit
at a time.

## Starter code

```python
# Uryiah: Grabbed 3 folders without consideration for color.
# Orlando: Chose folders in order: English, then Discrete Structures, then Biology.
# Connie: 3 different colored folders, doesn't matter what colors.
# Pete: Chose in order like Orlando and different colors like Connie.

import random

def Unordered_Uryiah( data ):
    print( "Placeholder" )
    return []


def Ordered_Orlando( data ):
    print( "Placeholder" )
    return []


def Combination_Connie( data ):
    print( "Placeholder" )
    return []


def Permutation_Pete( data ):
    print( "Placeholder" )
    return []



unordered_list = Unordered_Uryiah( [ "white", "green", "red", "blue" ] )
print( unordered_list )

ordered_list = Ordered_Orlando( [ "white", "green", "red", "blue" ] )
print( ordered_list )

combination_list = Combination_Connie( [ "white", "green", "red", "blue" ] )
print( combination_list )

permutation_list = Permutation_Pete( [ "white", "green", "red", "blue" ] )
print( permutation_list )
```

Right now when you run this, each person will have an empty list of folders.
We will update the functions to assign their folders, using the data passed in -
the list of folder colors.

## 1. Unordered_Uryiah

## 2. Ordered_Orlando

## 3. Combination_Connie

## 4. Permutation_Pete
