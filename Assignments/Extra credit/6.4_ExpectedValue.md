# Extra credit assignment: Expected values

You will write a program that simulates a die roll. 
In the program, you will compute the expected value using the theorem from chapter 6.4,
and you will also calculate the average by using a random number generator to "roll the die"
for a certain amount of trials (entered by the user).

You can write this programming assignment in any language.

### Declaring arrays

Create two arrays (or, in Python, lists). One will be storing the possible values we can get 
from rolling the die (1 through 6), and the other stores the probability for each die roll (1/6 for each outcome).

The array of values can be an integer, float, or double, but it will store the values of the die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

For example:

```c++
int values[6] = { 1,2,3,4,5,6 };
```

The array of probabilities will store 1/6 for each die roll. Note that you'll have to write these fractions
as decimal division in C++, otherwise C++ will truncate any data after the decimal point.

```c++
float prob[6] = { 1.0 / 6.0, 1.0 / 6.0, 1.0 / 6.0, 1.0 / 6.0, 1.0 / 6.0, 1.0 / 6.0 };
```

### Displaying the values and probabilities

At the beginning of the program, it should display all possible values and their probabilities.
You can do this with a simple for-loop:

```c++
cout << "Values and probability:" << endl;
for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++)
{
	cout << values[i] << "\t" << prob[i] << endl;
}
```

When it is running, it will look like this:

```
Values and probability:
1       0.166667
2       0.166667
3       0.166667
4       0.166667
5       0.166667
6       0.166667
```

### Calculate the expected result

We can use the formula from 6.4 to calculate the expected result.
First, create a **float** variable named `expected` and initialize it to `0`.

Then, create a for-loop that will iterate over `0 <= i < 6`...

```c++
for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++)
{
}
```

Within the for loop, yuo will calculate the value<sub>i</sub> * prob<sub>i</sub> and add it onto the expected variable.

After displaying it like this:

```c++
cout << "Expected: " << expected << endl;
```

The result should be 3.5.
