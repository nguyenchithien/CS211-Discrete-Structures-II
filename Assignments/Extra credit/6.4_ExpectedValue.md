# Extra credit assignment: Expected values

You will write a program that simulates a die roll. 
In the program, you will compute the expected value using the theorem from chapter 6.4,
and you will also calculate the average by using a random number generator to "roll the die"
for a certain amount of trials (entered by the user).

You can write this programming assignment in any language.

### Declaring arrays

Create two arrays (or, in Python, lists). One will be storing the possible values we can get 
from rolling the die (1 through 6), and the other stores the probability for each die roll (1/6 for each outcome).

The array of values can be an integer, float, or double, but it will store the values of the die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

For example:

```c++
int values[6] = { 1,2,3,4,5,6 };
```

The array of probabilities will store 1/6 for each die roll. Note that you'll have to write these fractions
as decimal division in C++, otherwise C++ will truncate any data after the decimal point.

```c++
float prob[6] = { 1.0 / 6.0, 1.0 / 6.0, 1.0 / 6.0, 1.0 / 6.0, 1.0 / 6.0, 1.0 / 6.0 };
```
