# Chapter 6 Project

Spring 2018

## About

For this project, you will write a progrma that will help you calculate **Expected Values**, using the formula from Chapter 6.4.

## Formula

Given some trial run many times, with *X* receiving a random value from the set
*{ x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub> }*, the Expected (Average) Value, *E[X]* is:

*E[X] = x<sub>1</sub> * Prob(X = x<sub>1</sub>) + ... + x<sub>n</sub> * Prob(X = x<sub>n</sub>)*

## Program Requirements

## Example Output

```
What is n(S), the amount of outcomes without restriction?
>> 36

How many outcomes are there?
>> 11

--------------------------------------------
OUTCOME 1:
         What is the value of this outcome?
         >> 2

         What is n(E), the amount of outcomes that have this value?
         >> 1

         Probability for this outcome is 1 in 36, or 2.77778%

--------------------------------------------
OUTCOME 2:
         What is the value of this outcome?
         >> 3

         What is n(E), the amount of outcomes that have this value?
         >> 2

         Probability for this outcome is 2 in 36, or 5.55556%

--------------------------------------------
OUTCOME 3:
         What is the value of this outcome?
         >> 4

         What is n(E), the amount of outcomes that have this value?
         >> 3

         Probability for this outcome is 3 in 36, or 8.33333%

--------------------------------------------
OUTCOME 4:
         What is the value of this outcome?
         >> 5

         What is n(E), the amount of outcomes that have this value?
         >> 4

         Probability for this outcome is 4 in 36, or 11.1111%

--------------------------------------------
OUTCOME 5:
         What is the value of this outcome?
         >> 6

         What is n(E), the amount of outcomes that have this value?
         >> 5

         Probability for this outcome is 5 in 36, or 13.8889%

--------------------------------------------
OUTCOME 6:
         What is the value of this outcome?
         >> 7

         What is n(E), the amount of outcomes that have this value?
         >> 6

         Probability for this outcome is 6 in 36, or 16.6667%

--------------------------------------------
OUTCOME 7:
         What is the value of this outcome?
         >> 8

         What is n(E), the amount of outcomes that have this value?
         >> 5

         Probability for this outcome is 5 in 36, or 13.8889%

--------------------------------------------
OUTCOME 8:
         What is the value of this outcome?
         >> 9

         What is n(E), the amount of outcomes that have this value?
         >> 4

         Probability for this outcome is 4 in 36, or 11.1111%

--------------------------------------------
OUTCOME 9:
         What is the value of this outcome?
         >> 10

         What is n(E), the amount of outcomes that have this value?
         >> 3

         Probability for this outcome is 3 in 36, or 8.33333%

--------------------------------------------
OUTCOME 10:
         What is the value of this outcome?
         >> 11

         What is n(E), the amount of outcomes that have this value?
         >> 2

         Probability for this outcome is 2 in 36, or 5.55556%

--------------------------------------------
OUTCOME 11:
         What is the value of this outcome?
         >> 12

         What is n(E), the amount of outcomes that have this value?
         >> 1

         Probability for this outcome is 1 in 36, or 2.77778%

--------------------------------------------
