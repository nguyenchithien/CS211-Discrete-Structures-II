# Chapter 5 Project

Spring 2018

## About

For this project, you will use any programming language that you're comfortable with to implement
simple programs that will compute Permutations, Sets, Ordered Lists, and Unordered Lists.

Each of these shouhld be implemented in a function that takes *n* and *r* as input variables, and gives the result as the return value.

## Formulas

For each of these *n* is the amout of choices, and *r* is the amount of items being selected.

![Formulas reference sheet](formulas.png)

* Ordered list: *n<sup>r</sup>*
* Unordered list: *C(r + n - 1, r)*
* Permutation: *P(n, r) = (n!)/(n-r)!*
* Combination: *C(n, r) = (n!)/(r! (n-r)!)*
